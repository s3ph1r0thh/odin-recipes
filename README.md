# odin-recipes

This is my attempt at the first project in the Odin Project.

The objective of this project was to create a very basic **recipe** website using only __HTML__.

In doing so, I was able to pratice the following:
*Github and Git repo setup and management, 
*Navigating the Shell, 
*Lists, images, and links in HTML, 
*Elementary elements and tags in HTML,
