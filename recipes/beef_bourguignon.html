        <h2>History of Beef Bourguignon</h2>
        <p>This rich stew originates from the Burgundy region of Eastern France, an area renowned for its architecture, excellent wines, and cattle. Beef Bourguignon was first mentioned in cookbooks in 1903, by chef Auguste Escoffier. It started as a humble peasant stew using up tougher cuts of beef by stewing them longer and eventually evolved into the iconic dish as it’s known today.</p>
        <p>Beef Bourguignon started as a peasants’ recipe, possibly dating as far back as the Middle Ages (400-1400 A.D.), as a way to slow-cook tough, unwanted cuts of meat using ingredients they had on hand. Beef bourguignon is traditionally made with Burgundy wine, hence the dish’s name. </p>
        <p>This Classic Beef Bourguignon is flavored with carrots, onion, garlic, pearl onion, herbs (like thyme and bay leaf), bacon, red wine, and mushrooms. All the flavors meld together while slow cooking in the oven into an incredibly rich and savory stew.</p>
    
        <ul><h2>Tools Needed</h2>
            <li>5 qt Dutch Oven</li>
            <li>Sharp Knife</li>
            <li>Cutting Board</li>
        </ul>

        <ul><h2>Ingredients & Substitutions</h2>
            <li><strong>Beef</strong>. Beef chuck is best here, but brisket also works!</li>
            <li><strong>Bacon</strong>. Bacon adds a delicious smoky and rich flavor to the beef bourguignon.</li>
            <li><strong>Veggies</strong>. Onion and carrot is classic here. </li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>. Garlic makes everything better!</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>. Flour helps thicken the beef bourguignon sauce. Read on for how to make this recipe gluten free.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato Paste</strong>. Tomato paste adds a rich, deep flavor. </li>
            <li><strong>Beef Broth</strong>. Homemade is always best, but the second best is the true beef stock you buy in the freezer section. </li>
            <li><strong>Beef Bouillon</strong>. A bit of beef bouillon bolsters the flavor of the stew. My favorite brand is “Better than Bouillon”.</li>
            <li><strong>Herbs</strong>. Fresh thyme and fresh bay leaves are the best here. You could use dried bay leaves if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Pearl Onions</strong>. Pearl onions are added later on so you get nice little pieces of onion that aren’t totally stewed. I used frozen, but you can definitely use fresh too. If using frozen, defrost the onions and drain them before using.</li>
            <li><string>Mushrooms</string>. Adding crispy sautéed mushrooms towards the end of the braise adds flavor while the mushrooms retain their meaty texture. </li>
       </ul>
