        <h2>History of Beef Bourguignon</h2>
        <p>This rich stew originates from the Burgundy region of Eastern France, an area renowned for its architecture, excellent wines, and cattle. Beef Bourguignon was first mentioned in cookbooks in 1903, by chef Auguste Escoffier. It started as a humble peasant stew using up tougher cuts of beef by stewing them longer and eventually evolved into the iconic dish as it’s known today.</p>
        <p>Beef Bourguignon started as a peasants’ recipe, possibly dating as far back as the Middle Ages (400-1400 A.D.), as a way to slow-cook tough, unwanted cuts of meat using ingredients they had on hand. Beef bourguignon is traditionally made with Burgundy wine, hence the dish’s name. </p>
        <p>This Classic Beef Bourguignon is flavored with carrots, onion, garlic, pearl onion, herbs (like thyme and bay leaf), bacon, red wine, and mushrooms. All the flavors meld together while slow cooking in the oven into an incredibly rich and savory stew.</p>
